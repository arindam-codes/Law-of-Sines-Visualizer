📐 Think Python Exercise: Generalizing Geometric Drawing

This solution addresses a classic exercise in computational thinking: designing a highly generalized set of functions to draw complex shapes by combining simple components.

The core challenge is to build a draw_pie() function that can draw a circle of any size, approximated by any number of n sides, using only a single segment drawing function triangle() .

i didnt use my paper instead i dont know why i used my wooden desk to solve the geomtery problem

i generelized the isosceles triangle the base as sin(fi) / ( radius of the circle * sin(theta) )
  where theta is angle btw adjacent sides 
  and fi is the rest two angle os the isosceles triangle 

so finally the outputs i got is
